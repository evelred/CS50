# [Problem Set 7: C$50 Finance](http://cdn.cs50.net/2016/x/psets/7/pset7/pset7.html)

***Note:*** *vendor, the folder that contains CS50’s PHP library, is not included in this repo folder.*

### Objectives
- Introduce you to HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL.
- Teach you how to teach yourself new languages.

### Project
Use a model-view-controller framework to implement [C$50 Finance](https://finance.cs50.net/), 
a Web-based tool with which you can manage portfolios of stocks. This tool can check the actual 
prices of real stocks using Yahoo! Finance data, as well as buy and sell stocks with paper money 
to create a mock portfolio! Per Yahoo’s fine print, "Quotes delayed [by a few minutes], except 
where indicated otherwise."

### *// TODO*
- Create a **database using MySQL and phpMyAdmin** to store usernames, hashed passwords, "cash" balances, stock purchases/sales info (e.g. transaction type, stock symbol, stock name, # of shares, price).
- Implement the **controllers** (all of the .php files in the /public folder).
- Implement the **views** (all of the .php files in the /views folder).
